pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(13, 2)	Wash'd by the sea, or on the gravelly bank	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(14, 2)	Thrown up by wintry torrents roaring loud,	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(15, 2)	Fearless of wrong, reposed his weary strength.	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(16, 2)	Those barbarous ages past, succeeded next	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(17, 2)	The birthday of invention, weak at first,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(18, 2)	Dull in design, and clumsy to perform.	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(19, 2)	Joint-stools were then created; on three legs	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(20, 2)	Upborne they stood, three legs upholding firm	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(21, 2)	A massy slab, in fashion square or round.	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(22, 2)	On such a stool immortal Alfred sat,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(23, 2)	And sway'd the sceptre of his infant realms;	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(24, 2)	And such in ancient halls and mansions drear	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(25, 2)	May still be seen, but perforated sore	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(26, 2)	And drill'd in holes the solid oak is found,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(27, 2)	By worms voracious eating through and through.	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(28, 3)	At length a generation more refined	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(29, 3)	Improved the simple plan, made three legs four,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(30, 3)	Gave them a twisted form vermicular,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(31, 3)	And o'er the seat with plenteous wadding stuff'd	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(32, 3)	Induced a splendid cover green and blue,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(33, 3)	Yellow and red, of tapestry richly wrought	swwswswwsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(34, 3)	And woven close, or needle-work sublime.	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(35, 3)	There might ye see the piony spread wide,	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(36, 3)	The full-blown rose, the shepherd and his lass,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(37, 3)	Lap-dog and lambkin with black staring eyes,	swwswwswws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(38, 3)	And parrots with twin cherries in their beak.	wswwsswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(39, 4)	Now came the cane from India, smooth and bright	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(40, 4)	With Nature's varnish; sever'd into stripes	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(41, 4)	That interlaced each other, these supplied	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(42, 4)	Of texture firm a lattice-work, that braced	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(43, 4)	The new machine, and it became a chair.	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(44, 4)	But restless was the chair; the back erect	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(45, 4)	Distress'd the weary loins that felt no ease;	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(46, 4)	The slippery seat betray'd the sliding part	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(47, 4)	That press'd it, and the feet hung dangling down,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(48, 4)	Anxious in vain to find the distant floor.	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(49, 4)	These for the rich: the rest, whom fate had placed	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(50, 4)	In modest mediocrity, content	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(51, 4)	With base materials, sat on well-tann'd hides	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(52, 4)	Obdurate and unyielding, glassy smooth,	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(53, 4)	With here and there a tuft of crimson yarn,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(54, 4)	Or scarlet crewel in the cushion fixt:	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(55, 4)	If cushion might be call'd, what harder seem'd	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(56, 4)	Than the firm oak of which the frame was form'd.	wwsswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(57, 4)	No want of timber then was felt or fear'd	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(58, 4)	In Albion's happy isle. The lumber stood	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(59, 4)	Ponderous, and fixt by its own massy weight.	swwswwswws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(60, 4)	But elbows still were wanting; these, some say,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(61, 4)	An Alderman of Cripplegate contrived,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(62, 4)	And some ascribe the invention to a priest	wswswwswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(63, 4)	Burly and big and studious of his ease.	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(64, 4)	But rude at first, and not with easy slope	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(65, 4)	Receding wide, they press'd against the ribs,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(66, 4)	And bruised the side, and elevated high	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(67, 4)	Taught the raised shoulders to invade the ears.	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(68, 4)	Long time elapsed or ere our rugged sires	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(69, 4)	Complain'd, though incommodiously pent in,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(70, 4)	And ill at ease behind. The ladies first	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(71, 4)	'Gan murmur, as became the softer sex.	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(72, 4)	Ingenious fancy, never better pleased	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(73, 4)	Than when employ'd to accommodate the fair,	wswswwswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(74, 4)	Heard the sweet moan with pity, and devised	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(75, 4)	The soft settee; one elbow at each end,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(76, 4)	And in the midst an elbow, it received	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(77, 4)	United yet divided, twain at once.	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(78, 4)	So sit two Kings of Brentford on one throne;	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(79, 4)	And so two citizens who take the air	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(80, 4)	Close pack'd and smiling in a chaise and one.	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(81, 4)	But relaxation of the languid frame	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(82, 4)	By soft recumbency of outstretch'd limbs,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(83, 4)	Was bliss reserved for happier days; so slow	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(84, 4)	The growth of what is excellent, so hard	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(85, 4)	To attain perfection in this nether world.	wwswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(86, 4)	Thus first necessity invented stools,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(87, 4)	Convenience next suggested elbow chairs,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(88, 4)	And luxury the accomplished Sofa last.	wswswwswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(89, 5)	The nurse sleeps sweetly, hired to watch the sick	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(90, 5)	Whom snoring she disturbs. As sweetly he	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(91, 5)	Who quits the coach-box at the midnight hour	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(92, 5)	To sleep within the carriage more secure,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(93, 5)	His legs depending at the open door.	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(94, 5)	Sweet sleep enjoys the Curate in his desk,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(95, 5)	The tedious Rector drawling o'er his head,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(96, 5)	And sweet the Clerk below: but neither sleep	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(97, 5)	Of lazy nurse, who snores the sick man dead,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(98, 5)	Nor his who quits the box at midnight hour	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(99, 5)	To slumber in the carriage more secure,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z200323200				(100, 5)	Nor sleep enjoy'd by Curate in his desk,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(1, 0)	I met a traveller from an antique land	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(2, 0)	Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(3, 0)	Stand in the desert . . . Near them, on the sand,	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(4, 0)	Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(5, 0)	And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(6, 0)	Tell that its sculptor well those passions read	swwswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(7, 0)	Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(8, 0)	The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(9, 0)	And on the pedestal these words appear:	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(10, 0)	‘My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(11, 0)	Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!’	wswswswsws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(12, 0)	Nothing beside remains. Round the decay	swwswsswws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(13, 0)	Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare	wswswsswws
pentameter	iambic	Z300484126				(14, 0)	The lone and level sands stretch far away.	wswswswsws
